## RabbitMQ Lazy Queues — Q\&A Guide

### 1. **What is a "Lazy Queue" in RabbitMQ?**

A **Lazy Queue** is a classic queue configured to move messages to disk as soon as possible. This minimizes memory usage, ideal for long-running, backlogged queues.
(\[turn0search6], \[turn0search5])

---

### 2. **Why use Lazy Queues?**

Use Lazy Queues when:

* Consumers might be offline or slower than producers.
* Queues may grow very large (millions of messages).
* Memory preservation and performance stability outweigh the need for the fastest message throughput.
  (\[turn0search6], \[turn0search10])

---

### 3. **How are Lazy Queues different from default queues?**

* **Default queues** store messages in memory for fast access, paging to disk only under pressure.
* **Lazy queues** write messages to disk immediately, keeping only a few in memory for delivery. This prevents sudden memory spikes and system slowdowns.
  (\[turn0search6], \[turn0search5])

---

### 4. **How do you enable Lazy Queue mode?**

#### (a) Prior to RabbitMQ 3.12:

You could enable it via queue declaration:

```java
args.put("x-queue-mode", "lazy");
channel.queueDeclare("myqueue", durable, exclusive, autoDelete, args);
```

Or via policy:

```bash
rabbitmqctl set_policy Lazy "^lazy-queue$" '{"queue-mode":"lazy"}' --apply-to queues
```

(\[turn0search6], \[turn0search4])

#### (b) Starting with RabbitMQ 3.12:

Lazy mode is the **default behavior** for classic queues, and the `x-queue-mode` setting is ignored.
(\[turn0search0], \[turn0search1], \[turn0search7])

---

### 5. **Is Lazy Queue mode still supported?**

No—since RabbitMQ v3.12, Lazy Queues are the standard behavior and the `x-queue-mode` parameter is deprecated/ignored.
(\[turn0search0], \[turn0search1])

---

### 6. **What are the pros and cons of Lazy Queues?**

**Advantages:**

* Predictable memory usage and steadier performance.
* Eliminates disk paging during memory pressure events.
  (\[turn0search10], \[turn0search6])

**Disadvantages:**

* Higher latency and lower throughput than memory-first queues.
* Not suitable for high-performance or always-short queue scenarios.
  (\[turn0search8], \[turn0search7])

---

### 7. **When should you use Lazy Queues?**

Use them when:

* Expecting message backlogs.
* Consumers might lag or disconnect.
* Stability and memory control are more important than instant message delivery.
  (\[turn0search8], \[turn0search10])

---

### 8. **When should you avoid Lazy Queues?**

Avoid them when:

* Expecting consistently high throughput and low latency.
* Queues remain short due to TTL/max-length policies, making lazy mode unnecessary.
  (\[turn0search8])

---

### 9. **How are Lazy Queues implemented under the hood?**

Messages are written to disk immediately. Only when a consumer is ready does RabbitMQ load a minimal set of messages from disk into memory for delivery.
(\[turn0search5], \[turn0search6])

---

### 10. **Any known issues with Lazy Queues?**

Yes—earlier versions of RabbitMQ could encounter issues when switching a long-running queue to lazy mode, such as queues hanging or causing CPU spikes. These were resolved in later releases.
