# RabbitMQ Publisher Confirms â€” Comprehensive Notes

---

## 1. Why Publisher Confirms Matter

Although RabbitMQ may receive a message from a client, it might crash before actually persisting that message to disk. Without confirmation, publishers would wrongly believe the message was safely accepted.

**Scenario:**

1. Client publishes to a **durable** queue with a **persistent** message.
2. Broker crashes **before writing to disk**.
3. Client reconnects and consumesâ€”but the message is **lost**.

**Solution:** Use **Publisher Confirms**. Without confirms, the client would receive no ACK and could handle the failure accordingly.
([RabbitMQ][1])

## 2. How Publisher Confirms Work

* **Enabled per channel**, not by connection or globally.

* Publisher sets channel to **confirm mode**, typically via something like:

  ```java
  channel.confirmSelect();
  ```

* Once in confirm mode, the **broker sends an ACK or NACK** for each message sent, confirming persistence.

* If the client doesn't receive an ACK (e.g., due to broker crash), it knows that the message may be lost.
  ([Stack Overflow][2], [RabbitMQ][3])

## 3. Publisher Confirms vs Transactions

* **Transactions** (txSelect, txCommit):

  * Provide **all-or-nothing** guarantees.
  * Are **synchronous** and **slow** (up to 250Ã— slower).
* **Publisher Confirms**:

  * Provide **asynchronous and lightweight** confirmation.
  * Far superior for throughput and typical production use.
    ([Stack Overflow][4], [Medium][5], [Google Groups][6])

---

## 4. Best Practices for Using Confirms

### Strategies for Confirm Handling

* **Individual publish + wait**:

  * Use `channel.waitForConfirmsOrDie(timeout)` after each message.
  * Reliable but **introduces latency** per message.

* **Batching**:

  * Publish multiple messages, then wait once for confirmations.
  * Higher throughput with reliability.

* **Asynchronous callbacks**:

  * Register listener functions for ACK and NACK events.
  * Highest scalability and performance.
    ([RabbitMQ][7])

### Recovery Considerations

* After reconnecting or recreating a channel, **re-publish any messages without a confirm**â€”you risk **duplicates**, so consumers should handle idempotency if needed.
  ([RabbitMQ][8])

---

## 5. Important Limitations & Behaviors

* Confirms only guarantee **broker acceptance**, not successful routing into queues.

* For guaranteed delivery to at least one queue, use the `mandatory` flag along with confirm logic.
  ([RabbitMQ][8])

* **Delivery tags** used in ack/nack messages are 64-bit and unique per channelâ€”overflows are practically impossible.

| **Strategies**           | Per-message confirms, batching, async callbacks                     |
| **Reliability Caveat**   | Acknowledges broker storageâ€”not routing (use `mandatory` if needed) |

### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Concepts**

**Q1: What are publisher confirms in RabbitMQ?**
A: Publisher confirms are a RabbitMQ feature that lets a producer know when messages have been successfully processed by the broker (persisted to disk or stored in memory). They provide an asynchronous acknowledgment mechanism at the channel level, improving reliability.

---

**Q2: Why are publisher confirms needed if RabbitMQ already has acknowledgments for consumers?**
A: Consumer acknowledgments confirm that consumers have received and processed messages. Publisher confirms, on the other hand, ensure that the broker has successfully taken responsibility for messages, reducing the chance of data loss.

---

**Q3: Are publisher confirms enabled by default?**
A: No. Publisher confirms must be explicitly enabled **per channel** using `confirm_select`.

---

**Q4: What is the difference between publisher confirms and transactions in RabbitMQ?**
A:

* **Transactions** guarantee stronger consistency but are slower because every publish must be committed.
* **Confirms** are **asynchronous** and much faster, designed for high throughput.
* Most production systems prefer publisher confirms over transactions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **How Publisher Confirms Work**

**Q5: How does RabbitMQ confirm messages?**
A: After a producer publishes a message on a confirm-enabled channel, RabbitMQ will eventually send back either:

* **Basic.Ack**: The message is successfully handled.
* **Basic.Nack**: The broker could not take responsibility for the message (e.g., due to internal error).

---

**Q6: How are confirms sent back to the publisher?**
A: Confirms are sent **asynchronously** over the same channel that was used to publish messages.

---

**Q7: Can confirms be per-message or batched?**
A: Both:

* A single confirmation can acknowledge **multiple messages** (via `multiple=true` flag).
* This allows batching, reducing overhead.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Performance and Best Practices**

**Q8: Why are publisher confirms considered lightweight?**
A: Confirms do not require a round trip per message; they are asynchronous and often batch acknowledgments, making them much faster than synchronous transactions.

---

**Q9: Whatâ€™s the recommended way to handle confirms for high throughput publishers?**
A:

* Use **asynchronous listeners** (callbacks) instead of waiting synchronously.
* Keep track of outstanding messages (e.g., in a thread-safe data structure).
* Batch multiple publishes and confirm them together.

---

**Q10: Should we use publisher confirms with persistent messages?**
A: Yes, especially for durability. When messages are marked as **persistent**, confirms ensure they are actually persisted to disk before acknowledgment.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Error Handling**

**Q11: When does RabbitMQ send a negative acknowledgment (Basic.Nack)?**
A: This happens when RabbitMQ fails to process the message (e.g., due to disk write errors or internal failures). A `nack` indicates that the publisher should retry or handle failure gracefully.

---

**Q12: Can publisher confirms guarantee that a message is delivered to consumers?**
A: No. Confirms guarantee that the broker has accepted and stored the message, not that it was consumed. Consumer acknowledgment is a separate mechanism.

---

**Q13: What happens if a publisherâ€™s channel is closed before receiving confirms?**
A: Messages that were not yet confirmed are lost. The application should track which messages were unconfirmed at the time of the channel closure and retry sending them.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Implementation**

**Q14: How do you enable publisher confirms in RabbitMQ?**
A:

```python
channel.confirm_select()
```

This makes the channel a confirm-enabled channel.

---

**Q15: How do you synchronously wait for confirms?**
A: Use methods like `waitForConfirms()` in RabbitMQ client libraries, but this is **not recommended** for high throughput systems.

---

**Q16: How do you implement asynchronous confirms?**
A: Register a callback function to handle `ack` and `nack` events asynchronously, tracking delivery tags to correlate messages.
